- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/your-username/fichaje-saas/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- Open a new issue to discuss your enhancement suggestion. Please provide a clear description of the enhancement and why it would be beneficial.

2.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3.  Ensure the test suite passes (`pnpm test`).
4.  Make sure your code lints (`pnpm lint`).
5.  Issue that pull request!
